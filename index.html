                looking to make a <br>transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for<br> 
                the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12<br>

                    Before joining the bootcamp, I ve<br>
                     never written a line of code. I needed<br>
                      come structure from professionals<br>
                       who can help me learn programming<br>
                       step by step. Iwas encouraged to <br>
                       enroll by a former student of theirs <br>
                       who can only say wonderful things<br>
                        about the program. The entire<br>
                         curriculum and staff did not<br>
                          disappoint. They were very hands-on<br>
                           and I never had to wait long for<br>
                            assistance. The agile team project, in<br>
                             particular, was outstanding. it took<br> my learning to the next level in a way<br>
                              that no tutorial could ever have. In <br>fact, I've often referred to it during<br> interviews as an example of my<br> developent experience, It certainly<br>
                               helped me land a job as a full-stack<br>developer after receiving multiple<br> offers. 100% recommend!
